Don't use this, I made a better one, `grass` https://github.com/therealdrflower/grass, it's younger by 3 months, but like even if you want to fork it just use the new one, I think it's better, loads from a file, probably better code.
<br>And I got this new license made (from yours truely, ChatGPT), and I heard you can't change a creative commons license, so.....
