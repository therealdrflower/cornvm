# numc
A very simple programming language written in C++, you use numbers in the code array.
Read the documentation.txt file for the, well, documentation. The first number must be 1010,
else the interpreter will not run your code!  For now it literally does nothing, maybe it would be made into something later on. Edit the CODE array and enter the Keynums. (for people that don't know, cd to the folder and then (in terminal) gcc/clang main.cpp -lstdc++ to compile the program)
