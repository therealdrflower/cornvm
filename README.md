# CORN Virtual Machine
CORN stands for Corn Oriented progRamming laNguage. It is a very simple Virutal Machine that reads the CORN programming langauge, edit the CODE array to program it. Good luck.

## For Linux/Mac users:
In terminal, type `bash run` to compile with clang, change it for GCC if you want.

## For Windows users:
Use your own method (sorry)
